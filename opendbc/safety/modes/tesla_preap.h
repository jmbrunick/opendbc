// ============================================
// SAFETY_TESLA_PREAP — Pre-Autopilot Tesla Model S (2012-2014)
// ============================================
//
// Standalone safety mode for Pre-AP Tesla Model S. These cars have NO
// Autopilot ECU, NO harness relay, and a different EPAS/CAN layout than
// HW1+ Teslas. This is the spiritual successor to Tinkla (Boggyver's
// Pre-AP openpilot fork, tesla_unity_betaC3 branch).
//
// WHY check_relay=false AND disable_static_blocking=true:
//
//   Pre-AP has no harness relay hardware. Standard openpilot uses a relay
//   on the harness to switch between stock AP ECU and openpilot — when
//   openpilot is not active, the relay routes CAN to the stock ECU. On
//   Pre-AP there is no AP ECU and no relay; the panda connects directly
//   to the car's CAN bus. Setting check_relay=true would cause the panda
//   to falsely detect a "relay malfunction" and block ALL TX permanently.
//   disable_static_blocking=true is required for the same reason — without
//   a relay, the panda's static blocking logic (which assumes relay state)
//   would incorrectly block messages.
//
//   Tinkla handled this identically via generic_rx_checks(false) in the
//   older panda API, with the comment "PreAP has no relay" (safety_tesla.h
//   line 1071, tesla_unity_betaC3 branch). The modern API added check_relay
//   and disable_static_blocking with restrictive defaults, so we explicitly
//   set them to get the same behavior Tinkla had implicitly.
//
// WHY ignore_checksum=true AND ignore_counter=true on RX:
//
//   Pre-AP EPAS firmware uses a byte-sum checksum, but the exact algorithm
//   has not been fully verified against all firmware versions. A checksum
//   mismatch caused a silent 21-second steering dropout during testing.
//   Tinkla's RX checks also had no checksum/counter validation (frequency
//   set to 0 for all messages). Once the checksum algorithm is verified
//   across all Pre-AP EPAS firmware versions, these can be re-enabled.
//
// ALL ACTUAL SAFETY CHECKS REMAIN FULLY ACTIVE:
//   - Steering angle + rate limits via steer_angle_cmd_checks_vm()
//   - controls_allowed gating on all TX
//   - Disengage on hands-on override (level >= 2), except during a
//     blinker-latched driver turn (one lamp XOR, physical LEFT/RIGHT,
//     flash-latched ~1s, then hand-on until release). ALC keep-alive
//     flashes and hazards are not a driver turn.
//   - Disengage on EPAS error codes 6-9, except during that same turn
//   - Disengage on door open, gear out of Drive
//   - Disengage on stalk cancel (with 600ms echo filter)
//   - AEB events blocked from openpilot
//   - EPB_epasControl mode validation
//   - Pedal TX gated by PREAP_FLAG_ENABLE_PEDAL + get_longitudinal_allowed()
//
// Completely independent from tesla_legacy.h — has its own hooks struct,
// counter/checksum functions, init, RX/TX/fwd hooks, and GTW emulation.
// Registered as SAFETY_TESLA_PREAP in declarations.h.
